    USER ||--o{ INTEREST : "has"
    USER ||--o{ CONNECTION : "has"
    USER ||--o{ INVITE : "creates"
    USER {
        int user_id PK
        string phone_number
        string username
        string location
        date created_at
        date last_login
    }
    INDUSTRY {
        int industry_id PK
        string name
    }
    INTEREST {
        int interest_id PK
        string name
    }
    CONNECTION {
        int connection_id PK
        int user_id FK
        int connected_user_id FK

   - Requires API key and secure connection (TLS/SSL)

6. Cloud Storage Service:
   - Interface for storing and retrieving user-generated content (e.g., profile pictures)
   - S3-compatible API for object storage
   - Requires access key and secret for authentication

7. Monitoring and Logging Service:
   - Interface for sending application logs and performance metrics
   - HTTP API for log ingestion
   - Requires API key for authentication

### COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

Pollen8 will utilize the following communication interfaces to ensure secure and efficient data exchange:

1. HTTPS Protocol:
   - All client-server communication will be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher
   - SSL certificates will be implemented for secure connections

2. WebSocket:
   - Used for real-time updates on user activities and network changes
   - Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol will be implemented for encrypted communication

3. RESTful API:
   - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations
   - JSON data format for request and response bodies
   - API versioning to ensure backward compatibility

4. GraphQL API (optional):
   - May be implemented for more efficient data fetching on complex queries
   - Uses a single endpoint with POST requests
   - Introspection for self-documenting API structure

5. OAuth 2.0:
   - Used for secure authorization with third-party services (if implemented in future phases)

6. SMTP:
   - Used for sending emails through the chosen email service provider
   - TLS encryption for secure email transmission

7. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
   - Interface for serving static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript files)
   - HTTPS protocol for secure content delivery

8. Database Connection:
   - Encrypted connection to PostgreSQL database using SSL
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization

These communication interfaces ensure that Pollen8 can securely and efficiently exchange data with its various components and external services while maintaining the performance and scalability required for a modern web application.
