# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

## AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

Pollen8 implements a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to user accounts and data.

### Authentication

1. **Phone Number Verification**
   - Users register and log in using their phone numbers
   - A one-time password (OTP) is sent via SMS for verification
   - OTP expires after 5 minutes for security

2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT is issued to the client
   - JWTs are used for subsequent API requests to maintain session state
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours, requiring re-authentication

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Optional feature for users to enable additional security
   - Implements Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as a second factor

### Authorization

Pollen8 uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| User | - View own profile<br>- Manage connections<br>- Generate and manage invites<br>- View network analytics |
| Admin | - All User permissions<br>- Access admin dashboard<br>- Manage user accounts<br>- View system-wide analytics |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Authenticated?}
    B -->|No| C[Redirect to Login]
    B -->|Yes| D{Authorized?}
    D -->|No| E[Access Denied]
    D -->|Yes| F[Grant Access]
```

## DATA SECURITY

Pollen8 prioritizes the protection of user data through various security measures:

1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - All sensitive data in the PostgreSQL database is encrypted using AES-256
   - Encryption keys are managed using a key management service (e.g., AWS KMS)

2. **Encryption in Transit**
   - All data transmitted between client and server is encrypted using TLS 1.3
   - HTTPS is enforced for all connections

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Only essential user data is collected and stored
   - Personal data is pseudonymized where possible

4. **Secure Data Deletion**
   - User data is securely erased upon account deletion
   - Data retention policies are implemented to comply with regulations

5. **Database Security**
   - Database access is restricted to application servers only
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are conducted

6. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Daily encrypted backups of all user data
   - Backup data is stored in a separate, secure location
   - Regular recovery drills to ensure data can be restored if needed

## SECURITY PROTOCOLS

Pollen8 adheres to industry-standard security protocols and best practices:

1. **OWASP Top 10**
   - Regular security assessments against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Implementation of security controls to mitigate common web application risks

2. **Security Headers**
   - Implementation of security headers including:
     - Content Security Policy (CSP)
     - X-XSS-Protection
     - X-Frame-Options
     - X-Content-Type-Options

3. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized on both client and server-side
   - Parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection attacks

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
   - Implements exponential backoff for repeated failed login attempts

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logging of all security-related events
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
   - Use of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system

6. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Regular vulnerability scans of the application and infrastructure
   - Timely application of security patches and updates

7. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Documented procedures for handling security incidents
   - Regular drills to ensure team readiness

8. **Third-Party Security**
   - Regular security assessments of third-party integrations
   - Vendor risk management program to ensure security of the supply chain
